An unexpected consequence of AI availability: the disappearance of natural stopping points in work and thinking.

Constant access to AI clarification removes the friction that previously forced breaks. "I don't know" used to create necessary pauses for reflection, but now clarity is instantly accessible. This elimination of productive struggle has created an uncomfortable realization.

The core tension centers on sustainability. Without ambiguity acting as a natural governor, the pace becomes relentless. Am I more effective or simply busier? Does increased output translate to greater impact?

Procrastination once provided something—not mere laziness, but recovery time and creative incubation. By removing "unproductive gaps," AI may enable an unsustainable rhythm.

Rather than offering solutions, I'm sitting with several questions:

- Does more output equal more impact?
- What now replaces natural work-stopping moments?
- Is this energizing or depleting?
- What does intentional rest look like when not forced by uncertainty?

The valuable skill isn't leveraging clarity, but knowing when to stop using it.
