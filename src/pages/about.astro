      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>This is a public journal.</p>

      <p>
        I use this space to preserve what I'm learning about growth, relationships, communication,
        work, and values as I move through life. I write primarily for my kids, so they can one day
        see how I thought, what I struggled with, and what I believed mattered. I also make it
        public so that family, friends, or anyone I care about can reference it if it's helpful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nothing here is meant to be definitive or prescriptive. These are not teachings or
        conclusions; they are snapshots of thinking in progress. Some ideas may evolve or change
        over time. That's intentional.
      </p>

      <p>
        I write infrequently and only when something feels clear enough to be worth keeping. A
        single paragraph can be enough. Silence between entries is normal.
      </p>

      <p>
        This space exists to clarify my thinking, leave a trail of learning behind, and model
        reflection and honesty over certainty.
      </p>

      <p>If you're reading this years from now: this was me, doing my best to pay attention.</p>
