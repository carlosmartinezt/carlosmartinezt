# Ethos

## Core Mission

This is a public journal where I preserve and clarify what I'm learning about growth, relationships, and values—primarily for my kids, and secondarily for anyone I care about who might need it.

If you hold yourself to that sentence, most decisions become trivial.

## What This Rules Out

- You are not trying to be timely.
- You are not trying to be complete.
- You are not trying to be impressive.
- You are not trying to grow an audience.

## What This Requires

- **Durability** — Content that remains relevant years from now.
- **Clarity** — Ideas expressed simply and directly.
- **Low friction** — Easy to write, easy to publish.
- **Editorial restraint** — Write only when something is clear enough to keep.
