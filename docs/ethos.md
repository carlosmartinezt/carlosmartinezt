# Ethos

## Core Mission

This is a public journal where I preserve and clarify what I'm learning about growth, relationships, and values.

**Audience layers:**
- **Today's readers:** family (wife, sister, in-laws), coworkers (reports, manager, colleagues), and friends (school parents, close community)
- **Ultimate audience:** my kids—they won't read it now, but someday they might

The kids are the north star, not the daily readers. Writing for them keeps the content durable and sincere. But the practical test is: would I share this with my sister? My team? A friend?

If you hold yourself to this framing, most decisions become trivial.

## What This Rules Out

- You are not trying to be timely.
- You are not trying to be complete.
- You are not trying to be impressive.
- You are not trying to grow an audience.

## What This Requires

- **Durability** — Content that remains relevant years from now.
- **Clarity** — Ideas expressed simply and directly.
- **Low friction** — Easy to write, easy to publish.
- **Editorial restraint** — Write only when something is clear enough to keep.
