## This is a public journal.

I use this space to preserve what I'm learning about growth, relationships, communication, work, and values as I move through life. I write primarily for my kids, so they can one day see how I thought, what I struggled with, and what I believed mattered. I also make it public so that family, friends, or anyone I care about can reference it if it's helpful.

Nothing here is meant to be definitive or prescriptive. These are not teachings or conclusions; they are snapshots of thinking in progress. Some ideas may evolve or change over time. That's intentional.

I write infrequently and only when something feels clear enough to be worth keeping. A single paragraph can be enough. Silence between entries is normal.

This space exists to clarify my thinking, leave a trail of learning behind, and model reflection and honesty over certainty.

If you're reading this years from now: this was me, doing my best to pay attention.
