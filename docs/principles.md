# Principles

These principles guide every editorial and design decision.

## 1. Audience is Layered

Today's readers are family, coworkers, and friends. Your kids are the ultimate audience—they'll read it someday. Writing with them in mind keeps content durable and sincere, but you're not writing *to* a 9-year-old. The practical test: "Would I share this with my sister? My team? A friend?"

## 2. Authority is Intentionally Limited

By saying "thinking in progress," you remove pressure to be right. This gives you freedom to write honestly and revise later without embarrassment.

## 3. Cadence is Defined Upfront

"Infrequent," "silence is normal," and "only when something feels clear" are guardrails. You are pre-emptively forgiving yourself.

## 4. Scope is Narrow but Deep

Growth, relationships, communication, work, values. These are lifelong themes. You are not reacting to the news cycle; you are tracking a life.

## 5. Tone Favors Sincerity Over Polish

The language is plain, almost spare. That's intentional. It keeps the bar low enough to publish and high enough to matter.

## 6. Legacy Without Grandiosity

You're not claiming importance—just attention. The goal is to leave a trail of learning, not to build a monument.
