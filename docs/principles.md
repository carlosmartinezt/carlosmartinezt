# Principles

These principles guide every editorial and design decision.

## 1. Primary Audience is Explicit

Your kids come first. This protects you from chasing validation or trends. Every edit should pass the test: "Would I want them to read this?"

## 2. Authority is Intentionally Limited

By saying "thinking in progress," you remove pressure to be right. This gives you freedom to write honestly and revise later without embarrassment.

## 3. Cadence is Defined Upfront

"Infrequent," "silence is normal," and "only when something feels clear" are guardrails. You are pre-emptively forgiving yourself.

## 4. Scope is Narrow but Deep

Growth, relationships, communication, work, values. These are lifelong themes. You are not reacting to the news cycle; you are tracking a life.

## 5. Tone Favors Sincerity Over Polish

The language is plain, almost spare. That's intentional. It keeps the bar low enough to publish and high enough to matter.

## 6. Legacy Without Grandiosity

You're not claiming importance—just attention. The goal is to leave a trail of learning, not to build a monument.
