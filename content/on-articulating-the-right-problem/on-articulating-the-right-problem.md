## Problem Statement

Lack of clarity causes teams to focus on wrong problems. Even strong execution produces poor outcomes when addressing symptoms rather than root causes. Real problems tend to be structural and ambiguous, so people naturally gravitate toward smaller, concrete problems that feel solvable. This generates activity without meaningful impact.

Solutions are appealing because they feel productive and create momentum. However, focusing on solutions prematurely obscures problem understanding. Emotional investment, sunk costs, and ego reinforce this cycle, sometimes for years.

## How Big Is This Problem?

Over twelve months, I noticed spending minimal time explicitly articulating problems—most effort went to discussing and executing solutions. Senior leaders spend considerably more time reshaping problem spaces, yet individual-level problem articulation gaps create significant organizational inefficiency.

## Proposed Solutions

**Spend dedicated time on problem articulation.** Use this structure: (1) problem statement, (2) problem size, (3) solutions. Keep statements short and treat solutions as suggestions, not commitments.

**Seek early feedback.** Share framings with managers or peers. Listen carefully without defending your perspective. The goal is improving understanding, not winning arguments.

**Step back strategically.** Ask why the problem matters, what outcome you're pursuing, and who benefits. Work backward from the end state.

**Broaden inputs.** Reading, listening, journaling, and reflection help prevent drifting into solution obsession.

**Timebox the process.** Perfect clarity rarely arrives. Commit, act, and learn from experience.

**Maintain balance.** Problem-solving can be draining; recognize that solutions energize us differently.

## Personal Story

I spent nearly two years pursuing a solution without understanding the actual problem. Initial logic seemed sound, so significant investment followed with emotional attachment developing. A colleague asked uncomfortable questions about beneficiaries, true goals, and personal motivations.

Upon reflection, the real issue wasn't a missing tool or structure, but a fundamental ability gap: recognizing the same concept across different representations. I had been "optimizing a workaround instead of addressing the root cause."

Re-articulation required time, emotional effort, and external perspective. Clarity arrived when the problem could be explained simply to someone without context.

## Key Takeaway

The fundamental challenge isn't specific products or systems—it's our collective capacity for clear problem articulation before committing to solutions. Einstein's wisdom applies: "If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions."

Solution quality depends directly on problem clarity.
