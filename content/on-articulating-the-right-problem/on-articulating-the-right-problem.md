## 🎯 Problem statement

Lack of clarity causes teams to focus on wrong problems. Even strong execution produces poor outcomes when addressing symptoms rather than root causes.

Real problems tend to be **structural and ambiguous**, so people naturally gravitate toward smaller, concrete problems that feel solvable. This generates activity without meaningful impact.

> Solutions are appealing because they feel productive and create momentum. However, focusing on solutions prematurely obscures problem understanding.

Emotional investment, sunk costs, and ego reinforce this cycle, sometimes for years.

## 📊 How big is this problem?

Over twelve months, I noticed spending minimal time explicitly articulating problems. Most effort went to discussing and executing solutions. Senior leaders spend considerably more time reshaping problem spaces, yet individual-level problem articulation gaps create significant organizational inefficiency.

## 🛠️ Proposed solutions

- **Spend dedicated time on problem articulation.** Use this structure:
  1. Problem statement
  2. Problem size
  3. Solutions

  Keep statements short and treat solutions as suggestions, not commitments.

- **Seek early feedback.** Share framings with managers or peers. Listen carefully without defending your perspective. The goal is improving understanding, not winning arguments.

- **Step back strategically.** Ask: Why does this problem matter? What outcome am I pursuing? Who benefits? Work backward from the end state.

- **Broaden inputs.** Reading, listening, journaling, and reflection help prevent drifting into solution obsession.

- **Timebox the process.** Perfect clarity rarely arrives. Commit, act, and learn from experience.

- **Maintain balance.** Problem articulation can be draining; recognize that solutions energize us differently.

## 📖 Personal story

I spent nearly two years pursuing a solution without understanding the actual problem. Initial logic seemed sound, so significant investment followed with emotional attachment developing. A colleague asked uncomfortable questions about beneficiaries, true goals, and personal motivations.

Upon reflection, the real issue wasn't a missing tool or structure, but a fundamental ability gap: **recognizing the same concept across different representations.** I had been "optimizing a workaround instead of addressing the root cause."

Re-articulation required:

- Time
- Emotional effort
- External perspective

Clarity arrived when the problem could be explained simply to someone without context.

## 💡 Key takeaway

The fundamental challenge isn't specific products or systems. It's our collective capacity for clear problem articulation before committing to solutions.

**Solution quality depends directly on problem clarity.**
