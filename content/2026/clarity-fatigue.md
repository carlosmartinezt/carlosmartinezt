An unexpected consequence of AI availability: **the disappearance of natural stopping points** in work and thinking.

## 🏃 The relentless pace

Constant access to AI clarification removes the friction that previously forced breaks. "I don't know" used to create necessary pauses for reflection, but now clarity is instantly accessible. This elimination of productive struggle has created an uncomfortable realization.

The core tension centers on sustainability. Without ambiguity acting as a natural governor, the pace becomes relentless.

> Am I more effective or simply busier? Does increased output translate to greater impact?

## 🛋️ The hidden value of "unproductive" time

Procrastination once provided something. Not mere laziness, but:

- **Recovery time** between deep work sessions
- **Creative incubation** that happens in the background
- **Natural boundaries** that prevent burnout

By removing "unproductive gaps," AI may enable an unsustainable rhythm.

## ❓ Questions I'm sitting with

Rather than offering solutions, I'm holding space for these:

- Does more output equal more impact?
- What now replaces natural work-stopping moments?
- Is this energizing or depleting?
- What does intentional rest look like when not forced by uncertainty?

The valuable skill isn't leveraging clarity, but **knowing when to stop using it**.
